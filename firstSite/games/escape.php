		<h2>Escape from Metropolis</h2>
		<h3>Christian Paul Dehli & Paul Hoisington</h3>
		<p>
		This game was created in C# using Microsoft XNA. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The goal is to jump over the crates (or shoot them) and then destroy the helicopter. 
		Once enough crates have been passed, a helicopter will appear. This helicopter must 
		be shot down to win the game. The helicopter drops bombs which will hurt the player
		unless the player is in the air.
