			<h2>Luna Racing</h2>
			<p>
				I created a 3d space racing game using mass based acceleration, basic machine learning, and networking (both XBox Live and System Link). 
                The competive nature of this game made it a hit for all the players. Some of the powerups could still use tuning, however it provided
                an overall exhilirating experience.

			<h2>Lite Tanks</h2>
			<p>
				Created a two player, Tanks meets Tron, video game. You must try to shoot your opponent
				while laying plasma behind you. You must shoot through your enemy's plasma in order to
				pass through it. It was programmed in C#, using XNA 4.0 Games Library, for the Xbox 360.
				It was coded in Fall 2013 with a team size of three.

				target to score points. It utilizes basic physics and has comical sound effects.

			<h2>Oppa Ninja Style</h2>
			<p>
				This video game was heavily influenced by PSY's popular song: 
				<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0" target="_blank">Gangnam Style</a>.
				You are PSY, and you must dance through each level defeating enemies with your throwing
				stars. The game was programmed in C#, using XNA 4.0 Games Library, for the PC.
				Levels can be created and imported using a text editor. It was coded in fall of 2012
				with a team size of two.

			<h2>Escape from Metropolis</h2>
			<p>
				This was my first video game made using the XNA Game Library. You are a stick figure trying
				to escape from a city. The goal is to jump over the crates (or shoot them) and then destroy 
				the helicopter. Once enough crates have been passed, a helicopter will appear. This 
				helicopter must be shot down to win the game. The helicopter drops bombs which will hurt 
				the player unless the player is in the air.
