        Created a two player, Tanks meets Tron, video game. You must try to shoot your opponent
        while laying plasma behind you. You must shoot through your enemy's plasma in order to
        pass through it. It was programmed in C#, using XNA 4.0 Games Library, for the Xbox 360.
        It was coded in Fall 2013 with a team size of three.

    <h2>Farting Darts</h2>

        This video game is the first 3d game I made. You shoot darts at a moving
        target to score points. It utilizes basic physics and has comical sound effects.
        The game was programmed in C#, using XNA 4.0 Games Library, for Windows PC,
        in spring of 2013 with a team size of three.

    <h2>Oppa Ninja Style</h2>
    <p>
        This video game was heavily influenced by PSY's popular song: 
        <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0" target="_blank">Gangnam Style</a>.
        You are PSY, and you must dance through each level defeating enemies with your throwing
        stars. The game was programmed in C#, using XNA 4.0 Games Library, for the PC.
        Levels can be created and imported using a text editor. It was coded in fall of 2012
        with a team size of two.

    <h2>Escape from Metropolis</h2>
    <p>
        This was my first video game made using the XNA Game Library. You are a stick figure trying
        to escape from a city. You must shoot your way through boxes or jump over them to reach your freedom. 
        At the end of each level, you must defeat an enemy helicopter.
